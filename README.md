## About
Fusion is an open-source webhook program that allows users to seamlessly port between the BeEF API and Fusion's own browser hook protocol. Fusion is independently owned and operated in Silicon Valley, California.
## How it Works
Fusion connects to the back end of a target's browser and displays a simple phishing page configured by the user. The credentials provided by the target allow Fusion BeEF to force undetectable entry into the target's machine. This entry is not visible to the target, and it allows the user to discreetly modify the user's machine to aquire their credentials and view their data. Fusion BeEF is meant to be used to infiltrate a computer and steal data, not money. Please follow our allowed use license at any time you are using Fusion BeEF or any BeEF API.
## Use and Licensing
